                neck—then thoroughly cleanse the area with baby wipes. There is no hope of hipness.
                As my friend A. A. Gill points out, after your daughter reaches a certain age—like
                five—the most excruciating and embarrassing thing she could possibly imagine is
                seeing her dad in any way threatening to rock.</li>
