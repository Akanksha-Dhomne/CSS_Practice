        <p class="special">This is an introduction.</p>
        <p>This is a paragraph with some text. A bit more text even.</p>
        <p class="special">A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all related to a single topic. </p>
        <p>Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs.</p>
        <p class="special">This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and end, and thus help the reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.</p>
        <p>Paragraphs can contain many different kinds of information. A paragraph could contain a series of brief examples or a single long illustration of a general point. It might describe a place, character, or process;</p>
        <p class="special">narrate a series of events; compare or contrast two or more things; classify items into categories; or describe causes and effects. Regardless of the kind of information they contain,</p>
        <p>all paragraphs share certain characteristics. One of the most important of these is a topic sentence.</p>
