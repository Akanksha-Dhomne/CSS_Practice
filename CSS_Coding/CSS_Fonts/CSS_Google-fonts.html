        <p class="first">“The essence of cool, after all, is not giving a fuck. And let’s face it:
            I most definitely give a fuck now. I give a huge fuck. The hugest. Everything
            else—everything—pales. To pretend otherwise, by word or deed, would be a
            monstrous lie. There will be no more Dead Boys T-shirts. Whom would I be kidding?
            Their charmingly nihilistic worldview in no way mirrors my own. If Stiv Bators 
            were still alive and put his filthy hands anywhere near my baby, I’d snap his 
            neck—then thoroughly cleanse the area with baby wipes. There is no hope of hipness.
            As my friend A. A. Gill points out, after your daughter reaches a certain age—like
            five—the most excruciating and embarrassing thing she could possibly imagine is
            seeing her dad in any way threatening to rock.
