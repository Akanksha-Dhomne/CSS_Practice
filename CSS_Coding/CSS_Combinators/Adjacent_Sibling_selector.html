        <h1 style="background-color: palegoldenrod;">Adjacent Sibling Selector (+)</h1>
        <p>The adjacent sibling selector is used to select an element that is directly after another specific element.</p>
        <p>Sibling elements must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means "immediately following".</p>
        <p>The following example selects the first <p> element that are placed immediately after <div> elements:</p>

        <div>
            <p>This is child of div element</p>
            <p>This is child of div element</p>
            <p>This is child of div element</p>
        </div>
        <p>THis is not a child of div element</p>
        <p>THis is not a child of div element</p>
        <p>THis is not a child of div element</p>
