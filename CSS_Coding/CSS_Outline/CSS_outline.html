        <h1>CSS Outline</h1>
        <p>An outline is a line drawn outside the element's border.</p>
        <p>An outline is a line that is drawn around elements, OUTSIDE the borders, to make the element "stand out".</p>
        <p>CSS has the following outline properties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>outline-style</li>
            <li>outline-color</li>
            <li>outline-width</li>
            <li>outline-offset</li>
            <li>outline</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Note:</b> Outline differs from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">borders!</span> Unlike border, the outline is drawn outside the element's border, and mau overlap oyher content. Also, the outline is NOT a part of the element's dimensions; the element's total width and height is not affected by the width of the outline.</p>
