        <h1>Setting max-width</h1>
        <p>The max-width property is used to set the maximum width of an element.</p>
        <p>The max-width can be specified in length values, like px, cm, etc., or in percent (%) of the containing block, or set to none (this is default. Means that there is no maximum width).</p>
        <p>The problem with the div above occurs when the browser window is smaller than the width of the element (500px). The browser then adds a horizontal scrollbar to the page.</p>
        <p>Using max-width instead, in this situation, will improve the browser's handling of small windows.</p>
        <p><b>Tip:</b> Drag the browser window to smaller than 500px wide, to see the difference between the two divs!</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> If you for some reason use both the width property and the max-width property on the same element, and the value of the width property is larger than the max-width property; the max-width property will be used (and the width property will be ignored).</p>
   
        <h2>Set the max-width of an element</h2>
        <div>This div element has a height of 100px and a max-width of 900px.</div>
        <p>Resize the browser window to see the effect.</p>
